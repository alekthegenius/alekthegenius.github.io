## 3d Printing

In this tutorial I will describe the basics of 3d printing, before we get started you should have 

- 3d printer, 
- Spool of PLA filament
- USB Flash Drive
- Mac or Windows Computer


In this first video, I will create a simple house in [Tinkercad](http://tinkercad.com) to be used for 3d printing.

After creating an object in Tinkercad, you then export it as an stl file.

After it has finished downloading, lets install Makerbot or whatever [slicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_(3D_printing)) is recommended for your 3d printer.
