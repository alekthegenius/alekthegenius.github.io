I have always had a passion for photography, and so in this instructable, I will describe how I created my own Raspberry Pi Digital Camera.

I began creating this digital camera with 3 objectives:

To have a small lightweight camera
To make it unique
To have full control over the camera settings, ISO, Shutter Speed, etc.
To fulfill my objectives, I first designed the camera case to be round, which reduces the size and weight of the camera, while also giving it a sleek, modern look. Using Python 3 and Tkinter, I also programmed an app to allow for full manual control over the camera settings and features.
