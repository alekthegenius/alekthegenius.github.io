Hi, Iâ€™m Alek. In my spare time, I code in Python, work on projects with my dad, and explore the world with my family. I love cross-country running and playing complicated Bach pieces on my classical guitar. I love the tranquil feel of fly fishing on a peaceful river in Colorado, and the sound of an elk, bugling from 50 yards away, in the middle of nowhere.
