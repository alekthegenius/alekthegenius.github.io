Hi, i'm Alek. In my spare time, I code in Python, work on project's with my dad, and explore the world with my family. I love cross country running, and playing complicated Bach pieces on my classical guitar.  I love the tranquil feel of fly fishing on a peaceful river in Calorado, and the sound of an elk, bugling from 50 yards away, in the middle of nowhere.
